# Nifty Index Movement Prediction with Linear Regression Ensemble

![Nifty Index](nifty_index.jpg)

## Overview

This project uses machine learning techniques, specifically Linear Regression ensemble models, to predict the movement of the Nifty Index after a correction (downfall) movement. The model takes corrected points of the Nifty Index into consideration to predict upward movements of specific points.

## Introduction

Predicting the direction of financial market indices like the Nifty Index can be valuable for traders and investors. This project aims to provide predictions using machine learning models based on historical data.

## Data

The data used for training and testing the model is collected from reputable financial data sources. It includes historical Nifty Index data, including price movements, trading volumes, and other relevant features. The data preprocessing and cleaning steps are detailed in the project code.

## Model

We use an ensemble of Linear Regression models to make predictions about the Nifty Index's movement after a correction. The ensemble model combines the strength of multiple linear regression models, enhancing prediction accuracy.

## Installation

To use this project, you need to install the necessary dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Before using the model, you need to prepare your Nifty Index data. Ensure it's in a suitable format and preprocess it as required.

2. **Training the Model**: You can train the ensemble model by running the training script, providing your preprocessed data as input:

   ```bash
   python train.py --input_data data/nifty_data.csv
   ```

3. **Prediction**: After training, you can use the model for predictions. Input the relevant features for a specific point, and the model will provide a prediction of the Nifty Index movement.

4. **Visualization**: You can visualize the predictions and compare them to the actual Nifty Index movements using the provided visualization tools.
